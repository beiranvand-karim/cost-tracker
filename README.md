# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### 'main project'

 Cost tracker
Purpose and scope
The purpose of this assignment is to create a small but still realistic project to form the basis of a discussion on how you approach web development. We
expect the project should not take more than a total 4-8 hours of work time to complete. If it takes much longer than that contact us to discuss reducing the
scope to make it possible to complete in that time.
Scenario
Anna wants to keep better track of her money. To help Anna do this, build a web app that allows her to enter the costs she has as she makes them, and
show how much it adds up to.
Requirements
Your web application should:
Allow the user to add cost items with a category and a comment for what it was
Show all cost items in a list
Show the total sum of the transactions
Allow the user to filter transactions by category
Use tooling you are familiar with. We use React, but if you are not familiar with React, it is better to use something you know well.
You don't need to build a storage backend, losing state on reload is fine. Using localStorage is also ok.
The application should work on both desktop and mobile devices with a clean and uncomplicated UI.
The project should be available and runnable for us, by following instructions in the project. It should preferably be available on GitHub or similar site.
What we will be discussing
Overall code structure
Naming, commenting
Documentation
Design decisions
Extensibility
Testing
Error handling
How styling is applied to the application
Responsive design
User experience in the application
